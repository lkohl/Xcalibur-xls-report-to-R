XCaliburXLS2R script

This script defines the function xcaliburxls2R, which reads xcalibur excel reports into R and returns a list of two data frames with peak areas and retention times for all peaks. all .xls and .XLS files in a given directory are analyzed.

example:
xcaliburxls2R("pathtomyfiles")

setup:
the package "gdata" is required for this script.

read.xls needs a running perl installation. this should be included in most linux distributions, but needs to be installed manually under windows. perl can be found

if not found automatically, set your path to perl at the beginning of the script.
